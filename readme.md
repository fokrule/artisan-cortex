# Artisan-Cortex

## Overview

This project, "Artisan-Cortex," is a foundational blog application developed using the Laravel framework. It served as one of my earliest projects to explore the core concepts of building a web application, including routing, user authentication, and database management with an MVC architecture.

## Project Snapshot (Laravel 5.1)

This repository is a legacy project, originally created in **Laravel 5.1** approximately 6-7 years ago. It is preserved here as a testament to my early work and learning journey with the framework. It showcases my foundational understanding of PHP and the Laravel ecosystem at that time.

Please note that this project is not actively maintained and is kept for historical purposes.

## Key Features

-   **User Authentication & Authorization:** Implements a full user authentication system with secure login, registration, and password reset functionalities.
-   **Blog Post Management:** Provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing blog posts.
-   **Content Tagging & Categorization:** Supports resource-based management for creating, updating, and deleting categories and tags for blog posts.
-   **Interactive Comments:** Includes a complete system for users to add, edit, and delete comments on blog posts.
-   **Protected Routes:** Utilizes middleware to protect core features and ensure only authenticated users can access certain parts of the application.
-   **Dedicated Pages:** Features dedicated routes for the blog's main pages, including About, Contact, and a dynamic blog index.

## Technology Stack

-   **Framework:** Laravel 5.1
-   **Language:** PHP
-   **Database:** Typically MySQL (as configured in a standard Laravel 5.1 setup)

## Getting Started

Due to the project's legacy version, the setup process may differ from modern Laravel applications. It would require an environment compatible with Laravel 5.1, including a specific version of PHP. The project is best viewed as a code sample rather than a deployable application.
